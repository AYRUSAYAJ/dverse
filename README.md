# README: AI-Based Healthcare Applications

## Overview

This repository contains three AI-driven healthcare applications:

1. **Parkinson’s Disease Detection** - Identifies early signs of Parkinson’s based on speech patterns.
2. **Hand Landmark Detection** - Uses computer vision to detect hand landmarks such as fingertips and joints.
3. **Heart Disease FAQ Chatbot** - Provides answers to common heart disease-related questions using NLP.

## 1. Parkinson’s Disease Detection

**Description:**\
This model analyzes speech data to detect early signs of Parkinson’s disease. It uses machine learning algorithms trained on a dataset containing speech features of Parkinson’s patients.

**Dataset:**

- The dataset includes speech recordings with extracted acoustic features.
- Common features: jitter, shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), and pitch variations.

**Implementation Steps:**

**Usage:**

## 2. Hand Landmark Detection

**Description:**\
This system detects and tracks hand landmarks (fingertips, joints) using computer vision and deep learning models.

**Implementation Steps:**

**Usage:**

## 3. Heart Disease FAQ Chatbot

**Description:**\
A chatbot that provides answers to common heart disease questions using NLP and text similarity techniques.

**Dataset:**

- Contains FAQs about heart disease, symptoms, causes, treatments, and prevention.
- Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find the most relevant answer.

**Implementation Steps:**

**Usage:**
